**ARMS-MBON** is a **European Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON)** of **Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS)**.

In ARMS-MBON we use ARMS units to sample the biodiversity of European coastal hard-bottom environments. Our ARMS units are placed for months at a time in the vicinity of marine stations, ports, marinas, and long-term ecological research sites distributed over Europe and the polar regions. They are populated by the surrounding hard-bottom communities, and once the units are retrieved, the organisms that colonised them are sampled and analysed. The aim of ARMS-MBON is to assess the status of, and changes in, the hard-bottom communities of these near-coast environments, using DNA (metabarcoding), image, and visual inspection methods. 

ARMS-MBON started in 2018 as part of ASSEMBLE PLUS (Horizon project nr 730984), and from 2023 it continues as part of EMBRC's <a href="https://www.embrc.eu/emo-bon" target="_blank">EMO BON</a> project. The (now-frozen) ARMS-MBON page on the ASSEMBLE Plus site can be found <a href="https:///www.arms-mbon.eu" target="_blank">here</a>; that will be replaced with a new page in due course. 

In ARMS-MBON, we use [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) to archive our raw sequences, [PlutoF](https://plutof.ut.ee/#/) for sampling event metadata and images, an [ARMS spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j3yuY5lmoPMo91w6e3kkJ6pmp1X6FVGUtLealuKJ3wE/edit?gid=1607535453#gid=1607535453) (a google sheet) for overview metadata and ENA accession numbers, and we run our bioinformatics analysis with [PEMA](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema). At regular intervals we upload all the metadata from PlutoF and the ARMS spreadsheet, and the outputs from PEMA, to our [ARMS-MBON GitHub site](https://github.com/arms-mbon). These are then quality controlled, semantically annotated, combined, and made openly accessible. The scripts and intermediate products arising from the quality control and combining processes are also available via GH. <br>

*A short word about our data packages.* We use <a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/" target="_blank">RO-Crates</a> to package our data files so that they are linked, described, and semantically annotated; every GH repository is a single RO-Crate. This Research Object approach is fundamental to making our data FAIR. Users can browse ARMS-MBON data [below](https://data.arms-mbon.org/#crates) by selecting the direct GH links (the GH icon) or the RO-Crate viewer links (the package icon).
