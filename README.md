**ARMS-MBON** is a **European Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON)** of **Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS)**.

In ARMS-MBON we use ARMS units to sample the biodiversity of the European coastal hard-bottom environments. Our ARMS units are placed for months at a time in the vicinity of marine stations, ports, marinas, and long-term ecological research sites distributed over Europe and polar regions. They are populated by the surrounding hard-bottom communities, and once the units are retrieved, the organisms that colonised them are sampled and analysed. The aim of ARMS-MBON is to assess the status of, and changes in, the hard-bottom communities of these near-coast environments, using DNA (metabarcoding), image, and visual inspection methods. 

ARMS-MBON started in 2018 as part of ASSEMBLE PLUS (Horizon project nr 730984), and from 2023 it continues as part of EMBRC's <a href="https://www.embrc.eu/emo-bon" target="_blank">EMO BON</a> project. The (now-frozen) ARMS-MBON page on the ASSEMBLE Plus site can be found <a href="https:///www.arms-mbon.eu" target="_blank">here</a>; that will be replaced with a new page in due course.  

At regular intervals, all ARMS-MBON (meta)data are uploaded from the various repositories we use (ENA for the raw omics data, PEMA drives for processed omics, PlutoF for images, Google Sheets for metadata), and are quality controlled, semantically annotated, combined, and shared with others on our [ARMS-MBON Github site](https://github.com/arms-mbon). The scripts and intermediate products arising from the quality control and combining processes are also there. This data landing page gives you access to these data and more. Use the menu to go to
