**ARMS-MBON** is a **European Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON)** of **Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS)**

In ARMS-MBON we use ARMS units to sample the biodiversity of the European coastal hard-bottom environments. Our ARMS units are placed for months at a time in the vicinity of marine stations, ports, marinas, and long-term ecological research sites distributed over Europe and polar regions. They are populated by the surrounding hard-bottom communities, and once the units are retrieved, the organisms that colonised them are sampled and analysed. The aim of ARMS-MBON is to assess the status of, and changes in, the hard-bottom communities of these near-coast environments, using DNA (metabarcoding), image, and visual inspection methods. The project started in 2018, and from 2023 it will continue as part of EMBRC's <a href="https://www.embrc.eu/emo-bon" target="_blank">EMO BON</a>  project. More information on the ARMS-MBON project can be found on its <a href="https:///www.arms-mbon.eu" target="_blank">home page</a>.  

This current webpage is the landing page giving you access to all the data collected by ARMS-MBON: a regular intervals all ARMS-MOBN metadata are uploaded from where they are created (a mix of ENA for the omics data, PlutoF for images, and googlesheets for metadata), and are quality controlled, semantically annotated, combined, and shared with others on our Github site. The scripts and intermediate products arising from the quality control and combining processes can also be found here.

(+) *A short word about RO-Crates and RO-Profiles.* We use <a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/" target="_blank">RO-Crates</a> to package our data files so that they are linked, described, and semantically-annotated, and every Github repository is a single RO-Crate. This Research Object-approach is fundamental to the way we share our data so that they are FAIR.
