    "description": "The European ARMS programme (ARMS-MBON) is a network of Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) placed in the vicinity of marine stations, ports, marinas, and Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites distributed over Europe and polar regions. The aim of ARMS-MBON is to assess the status of, and changes in, hard-bottom communities of near-coast environments, using genetic methods supplemented with image analysis and visual inspection methods. ARMS-MBON is part of GEO BONs Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON).",
